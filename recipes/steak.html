    <h1>Steak ü•©</h1>
		<p>
			The most simple and pure form of meat is the timeless steak. A delicious synthesis of protein, fat, and salt.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1"+ thick cut of steak (preferrably Ribeye or New York Strip)</li>
		</ul>
		Aromatics
		<ul>
			<li>butter</li>
			<li>garlic</li>
			<li>thyme</li>
			<li>salt</li>
			<li>pepper</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Prep</h2>
		<ol>
            <li>An important first step is choosing the steak. Look for steaks with good marbling. Even if the sticker grade is not the best, the only thing that matters is the actual marbling.</li>
			<li>
				Salt the steak 15 min before cooking (preferrably
				overnight)
				<ul>
					<li>If you don't have the time, <em>don't oversalt right before!</em></li>
					<li>You need to give the salt time to permeate through the steak</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, salt after cooking.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Cooking</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Place the steak down on a cold pan <strong>WITHOUT</strong> oil on medium heat.
			</li>
			<li>
                After 1 minute, flip the steak. Do this for both sides.
                <ul>
					<li>
                        The steak will not look appetizing at this moment, but we are aiming to create layers of browning, not the conventional style where you flash burn a crust on.
                    </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>As it starts to brown more, start flipping more often ~30 sec per side.</li>
			<li>When it seems like it has a beautiful crust, add a small bit of butter, garlic, and thyme.</li>
            <li>Remove the steak and aromatics into a alumnium foil, cover and let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
		</ol>
        <strong><em>Slice, Plate, and Enjoy!</em></strong>
