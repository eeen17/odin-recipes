		<h1>Oyako Don üêîü•öüçö</h1>
		<p>
			Oyako don is a beautifully simple dish that originates from Japan. It
			literally translates to "parent child over rice", referring to the chicken
			and egg together. It's delicious and very easy to make!

			<li>2 stalks of green onions</li>
			<li>1/2 cup short grain rice</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>

			<li>mirin</li>
			<li>Ajinomoto Hon Dashi (Bonito fish soup stock)</li>
			<li>water</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Prep</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Debone and salt the chicken thigh 15 min before cooking (preferrably
				overnight)
				<ul>
					<li>Make sure to salt under the skin too!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Cut the onion into crescent shapes</li>
			<li>
				Diagonally slice the greens of the gronions, and thinly slice the greens
				into small, thin circles
			</li>
			<li>Crack both eggs into a bowl and scramble.</li>
			<li>
				Mix soy sauce, mirin, water, and the dashi. Make sure it's not too
				salty.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Cooking</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Place the chicken thigh skin down on a cold nonstick pan <strong>WITHOUT</strong> oil.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the chicken fat starts to render out and it starts to sizzle, cover
				with a lid.
			</li>
			<li>Let it cook for 5 minutes on medium-high heat.</li>
			<li>
				Remove the lid, and flip the chicken to cook the other side.
				<ul>
					<li>
						At this time, the skin should be crispy, and the meat is white.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Place the chicken on a cutting board and let it rest.</li>
			<li>
				Throw the onion crescents and gronion greens into the still-hot oily
				pan.
				<ul>
					<li>Sautee until transcluscent and semi-sweet.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the sauce mixture into the onions and let it reduce a little.
				<ul>
					<li>While this is happening, cube the chicken thigh.</li>
					<li>(you may eat the skin as a chef's snack)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Throw the cubed chicken into the sauced onions to let it soak up the sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour scrambled eggs on top, and turn the heat to low. Place a lid on top to cook.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Make sure not to oversteam the egg, or else the texture will be off.</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remove the lid, and serve over a bed of steamed rice. Sprinkle the scallions over it.</li>
		</ol>
        <strong><em>Enjoy!</em></strong>
