		<ol>
			<li>
				Mix the water, yeast, and sugar.

					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour and salt.</li>
			<li>
				Slowly incorporate the wet mixture into the dry. Mix until it becomes a
				dough.
			</li>
			<li>Add olive oil and mix.</li>
			<li>Let it sit at room temperature for 40 minutes.</li>
